# Personal Kanban Board  

## Overview  
This project is a local implementation of a Kanban board inspired by Trello, designed to help manage and organize tasks, projects, and learning goals as I transition into a master's program. The application serves as a personal productivity tool, allowing me to keep track of various tasks related to my roles as a research engineer, my personal research interests, and my academic learning objectives.  

## Features  
- **Task Organization**: Create and manage tasks across different categories, including personal learning goals, research-related tasks, and professional responsibilities.  
- **Color Customization**: Assign distinct colors to tasks based on their category or role, making it easy to visually differentiate between various types of work.  
- **Drag-and-Drop Functionality**: Easily move tasks between different stages of completion (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done) using intuitive drag-and-drop interactions.  
- **Date Tracking**: Automatically record the date when tasks are added, helping to keep track of deadlines and project timelines.  
- **Future Enhancements**: Potential integration of a local small parameter language model (LLM) to summarize tasks weekly, enhancing productivity and accountability.
